//DiepAI is a program designed to play the online multiplayer game Diep.io.
//This program is currently a work in progress. However, it can control movement and aiming by itself. 
//DiepAI is divided into three main parts: the screen reader, the aim controller, and the movement controller.
	
//The screen reader reads a constant stream of screenshots directly from the screen. 
//For each screenshot, it searches for pixels with certain colors (relating to the colors in the game).
//Whenever it finds these colors, it traces around the outside of the shape and stores it as a shape object.
	
//The aim controller uses the shape data to decide where to move the mouse while playing the game.
//The aim controller is activated by pressing "[" and deactivated by pressing "]". 
	
//The movement controller uses the shape data to decide which direction to move. All movement in 
//the game is controlled by pressing the keys a, w, s, and d. 
//The movement controller is activated by pressing "," and deactivated by pressing ".".
	
//when bDisplayShapes is set to true, a JFrame will appear at the start of the program.
//The runnable_jar file has bDisplayShapes set to true for testing purposes. 
//The JFrame displays the current shape data the program has and updates it's display with each screenshot. 
//To test it, put the JFrame in one corner of the screen, and a picture with colors that it is looking for
//in another corner of the screen. The JFrame will display the shapes relative to it's size.
//The picture Pentagon_Nest.png is provided for this purpose.
//Occasionally, the program lags and the JFrame stops updating. If this happens, restart the program.
